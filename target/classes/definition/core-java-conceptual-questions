Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.
A set of commands, instructions, and symbols that humans can manipulate in order to communicate with computers.
Programming languages, like human languages, are defined through the use of syntactic and semantic rules,
to determine structure and meaning respectively. Programming languages are used to facilitate
communication about the task of organizing and manipulating information,
and to express algorithms precisely



What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?

A.
JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development
environment which is used to develop java applications and applets.It physically exists.
JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac),an archiver (jar),
a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.
jdk contain following components:
-jConsole: This is a Java monitoring and management Console.
-jar: This is the archiver. This tool is used to package related class libraries into a single Jar file as well as to manage Jar files.
-jarSigner: This tool is used for jar signing and verifying.
-javap: This is a tool for class file disassembler.
-javaws: Java web start launcher for JNLP applications.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.
java life cycle (JDL) is set of process and steps involved in developing java-based software applications.
the phases of java life cycle are:
-Requirements Gathering: This is the first phase in the JDL,
where the requirements for the software application are gathered, documented, and analyzed.
-Analysis and Design: In this phase, the requirements gathered in the previous phase are analyzed,
 and the architecture, design, and functionality of the application are defined.
-Implementation: This is the phase where the actual coding of the software application takes place
-Testing: Once the implementation phase is complete, the software application is subjected to rigorous testing.
-Deployment: Once the software application has passed the testing phase,
 it is deployed on the production environment.
-Maintenance and Support: This is the final phase of the JDL, where the software
 application is continuously maintained and supported.

what is class?
A.a class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes and behaviors of objects of a particular type.
What is object?
A.
Is an instance of a class that has it own state and behavior.objects are created based on classes.

What is the entry point of an application?

A.
he entry point of an application is the main() method. It is a special method that is called
when a Java application is executed, and serves as the starting point for the program.
( public static void main(String[] args)).


Why main is static?
A.
main() method is declared as static in Java because it needs to be called by the
JVM before an object of the class is created, and to allow it to be called from other classes without
 creating an instance of the class

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.
 the Object class is the superclass of all classes in Java, and provides a common set of methods and behavior
 that are inherited by all other classes.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.

Path :
- path is set for providing path for all java tools like java, javac,javah,jar,applet viewer
- it contains a path to the java tools( java,javap,javah,jre)
-use command to check path:>>echo %path%
CLASSPATH :
-is set of for provide path of all java classes which is used in java
- it contains a path of the classes provided by JDK
-all the classes are available in "rt.jar" file.
-use command to check classpath:>>echo %classpath%



What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.
Interface class:
-use interface keyword
-full implementation
-use implement word
-every method is always public and abstract
-100% pure abstract class
- we can not use any access modifier in interface because in interface everything is public
-every variable present inside interface is always public,static,and final.
-we can not declare instance and static blocks
-inside interface we can not declare constructors
-can achieve multiple inheritance with interface.
Abstract class:
-use abstract keyword
-partial implementation
-use extend word
-method need not to be public and abstract
-can take concrete methods also
-there are no restrictions on abstract class method modifiers
-variable does not need to be public static and final
-no restriction on abstract class variable modifiers
-we can declare a constructor.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.
we cannot create an object from an interface or an abstract class in Java, because they are not fully
implemented and are intended to be used as base classes for other classes.
the  object is concrete and abstract class and interface  are sort of like a template,
or an empty/partially empty structure, you have to extend it and build on it before
you can use it and create an object.


what is Access Specifier?
A.
access specifiers are keywords that determine the level of access that other classes and code
 have to a particular class,method, or variable. There are four access specifiers in Java:
 -public: access from all classes
 -private:declared class ( same class)
 -protected:same package and subclass
 -default: same package

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects
 to represent and manipulate data. In OOP, data is encapsulated within objects, and objects are defined
  by their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).
OOP provides several key concepts that enable developers to write modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

-Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object
from the outside world and only exposing
a set of public methods that can be used to interact with the object
-Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Java,
 polymorphism is achieved through the use of method overloading and method overriding.
-inheritance:Inheritance is the process of creating a new class from an existing class. The new class
inherits all the properties and behaviors of the existing class and can also
add its own properties and behaviors
-Abstraction:Abstraction is the process of representing complex real-world objects in simplified form.
 In Java, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.
In Java, the package is the collection of Java classes and interfaces and is a folder in a file directory.
We use packages to avoid name conflicts, andPackages are divided into two categories:

1-Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
2-User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
When we use the classes of a particular package, we need to import that particular package in which that classes are defined.
When we use the classes of a particular package, we need to import that particular
package in which that classes are defined.
This means that you can use classes and interfaces from the java.lang package,
without explicitly importing them into your code.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols,
routines, and tools for building software applications.
n simpler terms, an API is like a messenger that takes a request from a user or another software application,
sends it to a server, retrieves the response, and delivers it back to the user or application that made the request
Use it when i log in to application like facebook, while using google map, amazon,twitter , etc....

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?

A.

java does not support multiple inheritance except if we use interface.
because  multiple inheritance  can create conflicts and ambiguities in the inheritance tree
easy-to-use language, and allowing multiple inheritance would have made it more complicated and harder to understand.

What is method overloading and when it happens?

A.overloading is an approach of polymorphism concept.
Overloading happens when you have two methods with the same name but different signatures (or arguments)
overloading is an example of compile time polymorphism

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.?

A. is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program.When an exception occurs,the program terminates abruptly,
and an error message is displayed on the console.
-To handle an exception in Java, you can use a try-catch block.
 The try block contains the code that may throw an exception,
and the catch block contains the code that is executed when the exception is caught

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?

A.
-is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variables , methods, blocks and nested classes
The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.
In very simple word we create only one copy of that static member that is shared with all instance/object
-We use static var When the value is supposed to be shared across all objects

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.
The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user, Final can be:
-Variable we can't change of value of it
-Method, we can’t override it
-Class, we can’t extend it (immutable class instance of final class can’t change value)
-Final blank variable can initialize only in constructor

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.
final : is used to declare constants or to prevent inheritance or method overriding.
finally : is used to ensure that a block of code is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.
finalize: is a method that is called by the garbage collector when an object is about to be destroyed,
and it can be overridden to perform cleanup operations.

What is a constructor ?
A.
special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
Constructor name must be the same as its class name
Constructor must have no return type
cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
Can be public and have parameter
If we don’t create constructors by default java do

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.
yes, we can have a multiple constructor.A class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists,
 allowing the programmer to create objects in different ways with different initial state.
This is called constructor overloading
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.
default constructor( classname())

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.
to refer current class instance variable or invoke current class method (this.var , this.method)
and we can pass it as argument.
This(): to invoke current class constructor

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.
Super to refer immediate parent class instance variable or method (super.var , super.method)
super() to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

What is JVM stand for ?
A.
java virtual machine does not  exist physically, is to load translate and execute the code


Is JVM platform independent?

A.
 yes JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE is  Independent platform  because main important point is that programs written
  in Java can be run on multiple platforms without re-writing them individually for a particular platform.
  This is due to the JVM's ability to abstract away hardware and operating system dependencies,
  providing a consistent runtime environment for Java programs.

What version of java are you using?
A.
 version is : 11.0.17
What is JAR stand for ?
A.
JAR stands for Java ARchive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and
is used for aggregating many files into one.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.
JDK (Java Development Kit) and JVM (Java Virtual Machine) are both important components of the Java platform,
but they serve different purposes.
-JDK is a development kit used to create Java applications, while JVM is a runtime environment
used to execute Java programs. While JDK includes the JRE, it also includes many other tools that are
not included in the JRE.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.
RE is a runtime environment used to execute Java programs, while JVM is the component responsible for actually
running the programs. The JRE includes the JVM along with other components needed for running Java programs, while
the JVM alone cannot run Java programs without the required libraries and components that are included in the JRE.

What is compile time and run time?
A.
Compile time is the period when the programming code (Java) is converted to the machine code (binary code).
Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time
What is heap?
A.
The heap is a memory used by programming languages to store global variables.
 By default, all global variable are stored in heap memory space

How java manage it's memory?
A.
Java uses an automatic memory management system called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to manage its memory.
The JVM divides memory into two areas: the heap and the stack.
2 mechanism used in memory management:
- in garbage collection mechanism: an object is no longer referenced by any part of the application,
 it becomes eligible for garbage collection
 -"finalize" method which allows objects to perform cleanup actions before they are garbage collected

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.
String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder are classes in Java that represent sequences of characters.
The main difference between them is how they handle string manipulation.
String:
-String is an immutable class
StringBuffer:
-mutable classes that allow efficient manipulation of strings.
-it is Thread-safe
-Present from Java 1.0
-it can use only one thread at a timr
-multiple threads needs to wait for synchronization
-performance is very low
StringBuilder:
-mutable classes that allow efficient manipulation of strings.
-it is not thread-safe
-introduction in java 1.5
-it can use multiple threads at a time
-multiple threads can operate together without synchronization
-performance is high

What is Singleton class?
A.
Singleton is a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.
Serialization is  processes of converting an object into a stream of bytes.
 deserialization  is converting that stream of bytes back into an object

when to use transient variable in java?
A.
When a variable is marked as transient, its value is not included in the serialized stream.
This is useful when a variable contains sensitive data that should not be stored or transmitted,
or when the variable is derived from other data and can be reconstructed when the object is deserialized.

Difference between while and do..while loop?

A.
The while loop first checks the condition before executing the block of code.
The do..while loop, on the other hand, executes the block of code at least once, and then checks the condition.

What is Enum?

A.
Enum is special class that contains a fixed set of constants ( unchangeable variables). we use enum keyword to declare
enums. The enums constants are usually represented in uppercase separated by comma.
What is Iterator?
An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections,
like ArrayList and HashSet. It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.
To use an Iterator, you must import it from the java.util package.


Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?

As already mentioned int is a primitive data type and takes 32 bits(4 bytes) to store.
 On other hand Integer is an object which takes 128 bits (16 bytes) to store its int value

Why is String Immutable in Java?

A.
the String class in java is immutable, and the content of string objects in java ca not be changed
 old value can not be changed to a new value, the reference to old value with remove and it just
 created a reference to the new value.if a value has many reference it just create String pool.
String is immutable in Java because this offers several benefits:
1- String pool(value has many reference) is possible because String is immutable in Java:Caching the String literals and reusing
them saves a lot of heap space because different String variables refer to the same object in the String pool.
String intern pool serves exactly this purpose.

2-It increases security because any hacker can't change its value and it's used for storing sensitive
 information such as a database username or password. and it's easier to operate with sensitive code when
 values don't change
 3- hash code catching :
 improves the performance of collections that uses hash implementations when operated with String objects.
 4-performance:
 it enhances the performance by saving heap memory and faster access of
 hash implementations when operated with Strings.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A.
is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current objects by
using this(), if it is in the same class or super(), if it is from parent class.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.
Serial garbage collector :
-single thread
-freeze all application when it runs
-simple and requires a less memory
-good for a small application
-slower
Parallel Garbage Collector:
-multiple thread
-program still run while garbage collection
-more complex to implement and require a more memory
-good for larger application
- faster and more efficiently

What is JIT stands for?
A.
Just-In-Time compiler ( runtime compilation) is a component of Java Runtime Environment that improves the
performances of Java application a run time.
it turns Java bytecode into instructions that can be sent directly to the processor.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.
The Java heap is the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM.
The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.
Garbage collection is the automated process of deleting code that's no longer needed or used.
 When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected and during the garbage collection objects that are
 no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.


Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.
they may be situations where it's fails to collect certain objects.There are no guarantees when it comes to garbage
collection.It is programmers responsibility to ensure that objects no longer in use are no longer referenced by the
application.


What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.
Heap:
-used by all part of the application
-larger area of memory
-store objects and data structures
-memory allocated is managed by JVM garbage collector.
Stack:
-used by one thread of execution
-small area of memory
-store temporary variables and methods calls.
-memory allocated is automatically freed when method returns




What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.
Reflection is an API that is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes,
and interfaces at runtime
Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class
that can be executed by using the object.
Through reflection, we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.
reflection can be used:
-building tools and frameworks
-creating dynamic code
-accessing a private members
-enhancing performance



what is multithreading in java?
A.
is the process of executing multiple threads simultaneously within a single Java program.
 is the ability of a program or an operating system to enable more than one user at a time without
requiring multiple copies of the program running on the computer.
multithreading in java perform multiple tasks at the same time, and making it more efficient and responsive.




What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.
 synchronization is the capacity to control the access of multiple threads to any shared source.it can use to :
 -ensure that only one thread at a time can execute.while other threads wait for access.
 -thread safety by preventing multiple threads
 -consistency: by ensuring that shared data is accessed in predictable and controlled manner.
 -deadlock prevention: by preventing deadlocks in multithreaded environment.

What is Framework?
A.
is a reusable, pre-written software component or module that provides a
structure or a set of rules for developing applications.
is Framework the  pre-written code to which you add your own code in order to solve a problem.
 You make use of a framework by calling its methods, inheritance, and supplying callbacks,
  listeners, or other implementations of the patterns.


What are the testing Framework available in java?
A.
-JUnit
-TestNG
-Mockito
-Selenium.
-Cucumber
-Arquillian



Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A.
junit:
- it's an open -source testing framework used for writing and running tests
-it does not support advanced annotations
-it does not support parallel test execution
-the group test features does not exist in JUnit
-the process of configuration of parameterized test is much easier in TestNG
-various modules are needed to write test cases.
testNG:
-is another testing framework similar to JUnit, but with added functionalities and features
-it supports advanced and special annotations
-it allows different threads to run simultaneously
-group test in an innovative feature of testNG
-the configuration of parameterized test is a difficult and time-consuming process in JUnit.
-it is better than JUnit in terms of ease of use


What are the dependencies for this project?
A.
dependencies is external library obtained from repository of maven central ( maven use pom.xml).

what is dependency injection in java?
A.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Java that allows
developers to remove hard-coded dependencies between components of an application,
making them more modular and easier to maintain.
and  dependency injection is a strategy that is used to separate the creation of dependency objects from
the class that needs them.




What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A.
two types of binding used in Java to link a method call to its implementation.
Static binding :
 -called early binding because it happens during compilation
 -uses overloading/operator Overloading methods
 -real object is never used in static building
 -can take a place using normal functions
dynamic binding :
-called late binding because it happens during runtime.
-uses overriding method
-real object can be used in dynamic binding
-can be achieved using a virtual functions
