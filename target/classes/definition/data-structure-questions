Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.
Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.
Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information
so that machines and humans can better understand it

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.
Searching – We can easily search for any data element in a data structure.
Sorting – We can sort the elements either in ascending or descending order.
Insertion – We can insert new data elements in the data structure.
Deletion – We can delete the data elements from the data structure.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A.
Data structures are used in any program or software.
They are used in the areas of :
-compile design
-Operating System
-DBMS
-Graphics
-Simulation
-Numerical Analysis
-Artificial Intelligence
what is an Array?
A.
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A.
ArrayList has only object-type data entries and not primitive data types
what is LinkedList?
A.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A.
A linked list in Java is a dynamic data structure
whose size increases as you add the elements and decreases as you remove the elements from the list.
what is queue?
A.
a queue is an abstract data type that represents a collection of elements,
where the elements are added at one end of the collection, called the rear or tail,
and removed from the other end, called the front or head, according to the FIFO
what is stack?
A.
stack is an abstract data type that represents a collection of elements,
 where the elements are added and removed according to the LIFO

what is FIFO and LIFO?

A.
FIFO and LIFO are two common methods of organizing and manipulating data in computer science.

FIFO stands for "First-In, First-Out" and it is a method of data
manipulation in which the first element that is added to a data structure is the first one to be removed.
LIFO stands for "Last-In, First-Out" and it is a method of
data manipulation in which the last element that is added to a data structure is the first one to be removed.
what is the order of complexity?
A.
The most common complexity classes are (in ascending order of complexity): O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²).
 Algorithms with constant, logarithmic, linear,
 and quasilinear time usually lead to an end in a reasonable time
 for input sizes up to several billion elements
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A.
The best-case scenario for searching an element in an array is when the element
 is found at the first index of the array.This means that the time complexity of the search operation is constant and O(1),
 which is the best possible time complexity for any search operation.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A.
when the search item appears at the end of the list or not at all.
what is tree in data structure?
A.
A Tree is a non-linear data structure
A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is
used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search.

what is graph in data structure?

A.
A graph data structure mainly stores connected data
Graphs in data structures are non-linear data structures made up of a finite number of nodes or
 vertices and the edges that connect them.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A.
-HashMap is non-syncronized and is not thread safe while HashTable is thread safe and is synchronized.
-Null values: Hashtable does not allow null keys or values, whereas HashMap allows one null key
and any number of null values.
-iteration: Hashtable is enumerated
-Performance: Hashtable is slower than HashMap because of its synchronization overhead.
-Inheritance: Hashtable is a subclass of the Dictionary class,
whereas HashMap is a subclass of the AbstractMap class.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas :
RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A.
RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
Network data model = Graph.
Hierarchical data model = Trees.

How HashMap works in java?

A.
-HashMap is a popular data structure in Java used for storing and retrieving key-value pairs.
-It works by storing the keys and their corresponding values in an array-like structure called a bucket,
using the hash value of the key to determine the index of the bucket in which the key-value pair is stored.
HashMap uses hashCode() and equals() methods on keys for get and put operations.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A.
The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a runtime exception in Java that
 occurs when an array is accessed with an illegal index( index outside the valid range of indexes for that array).


What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A.
You can use a for loop and copy elements of one to another one by one.
Use the clone method to clone an array.
Use arraycopy() method of System class.
Use copyOf() or copyOfRange() methods of Arrays class.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A.
array:
-size of array is fixed
-memory is allocated from stack
-number of elements should be specified
-occupy less memory
-inserting a new elements
-deleting an element is impossible
array-linked list:
-size of list is not fixed
-memory is allocated from heap
-is not necessary to specify the number of elements declared
-it occupies more memory
-deleting an element is possible

What is DFS and BFS?
A.
DFS and BFS are two popular graph traversal algorithms used in computer science and programming.
-Depth-First Search (DFS) : is a graph traversal algorithm that visits nodes in a depth-first order,
 meaning it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
 Breadth-First Search (BFS): is a graph traversal algorithm that visits nodes in a breadth-first order,
 meaning it explores all the nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next level.

What is Recursion?
A.
Recursion in java  the technique of making a method  call itself.
with a modified input until it reaches a base case that does not require further recursive calls.


What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A.
-A linear data structure is a type of data structure where the data elements are organized in a linear order,
such that each element has a unique predecessor and a unique successor, except for the first and last elements.
- a non linear data structure is where the elements are arranged hierarchically, with each element having one or more predecessors
and one or more successors

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A.
describes the set of all algorithms that run no worse than a certain speed.
s commonly used in computer science to analyze the efficiency of algorithms and to compare
 the relative performance of different algorithms.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A.
Heap Sort :Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Insertion Sort:Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Selection Sort:Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Bubble Sort:Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Quick sort: Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Merge Sort:Time Complexity: O(n log n)

  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
